# Insurance Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for an insurance system. The contract allows users to create insurance policies, submit claims, and manage policy cancellations.

## Features

- Create new insurance policies by paying the premium amount.
- Submit claims against active policies, specifying the claim amount and reason.
- Policy cancellation by the contract owner, with appropriate payouts based on approved claims.
- Keep track of policy details, claims, and payout information.

## Dependencies

The smart contract uses the following dependency:

- OpenZeppelin Contracts: A library for secure smart contract development.

## License
This smart contract is released under the MIT License. 

## Contract Details
The main contract file is Insurance.sol, which contains the implementation of the insurance system. It utilizes the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin for contract ownership functionality.

## The contract consists of the following key components:

- Policy struct: Represents an insurance policy with associated details such as premium, coverage amount, expiration date, policy holder, and more.
- Claim struct: Represents a claim submitted against a policy, including the claim amount, reason, approval status, payout amount, and payout date.
- policies mapping: Stores all the policy information, with each policy mapped to its unique identifier.
- policyCounter and totalClaims variables: Keep track of the policy and claim counts, respectively.
Various events: Emit events for important contract actions such as policy creation, cancellation, claim submission, approval, denial, and claim payout.


## Getting Started

Interact with the deployed contract using web3.js or other Ethereum client libraries.

To get started with the smart contract, follow these steps:
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install


## Deploy the contract to a blockchain network using a deployment framework like Truffle or Hardhat:
//Replace <network> with the desired network (e.g., development, ropsten, etc.)
truffle migrate --network <network>
